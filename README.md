Build a Bot to do basic mathematical operations

Proposed workflow for the Bot

1.
Take two operands and operation as input and show the output

2.
Show the available mathematical operations

•
You can use a simple menu based approach to take the operation

•
Example categories : “addition”, subtraction”, ”multiplication”, “division”

3.
Based on these input show the output for the users

4.
After the flow ends - If a user says ”more operations” , take the new inputs and proceed

•
For example ( let us say user asked for sum of 4 and 5 )

Case 1

User : hi
Bot  : what mathematical operation do I want to do?
User : add
Bot  : what is the first operand?
User : 4
Bot  : what is the second operand?
User : 5
Bot  : sum of 4 and 5 is 9
Case 2

User : start another operation
Bot  : what mathematical operation do I want to do?
User : division
Bot  : what is the first operand?
User : 5
Bot  : what is the second operand?
User : 0
Bot  : can't be 0, enter a valid operand!
User : 2
Bot  : division of 5 by 2 is 2.5
Notes

•
 Bonus - Handle small talk in English (basic greetings)

•
Build your Chatbot in any language of your choice (Preferred - RASA)

Deliverables

•
Push the code into public GitHub repo and also add screenshots of your output
